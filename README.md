# Hospital Chatbot Backend (FastAPI)

## Overview
This project is a FastAPI-based hospital chatbot that integrates AI-powered interactions with hospital services. It leverages **LangGraph** for agentic behavior and **MemorySaver** for persistent interactions. The chatbot can:

- Retrieve a list of available doctors
- Book doctor appointments
- Process medical bill payments
- Check hospital pharmacy medicine availability
- Perform patient symptom checks using AI

## Features
### ‚úÖ AI-Powered Conversational Agent
- Uses **LangGraph** for managing conversational states and decision-making.
- Implements **MemorySaver** to store chat history and ensure smooth interactions.
- Uses **ChatOpenAI (GPT-4o-mini)** to generate responses.

### üè• Hospital Management Functions
- **Doctor Listing:** Fetches available doctors and their specialties.
- **Appointment Booking:** Schedules appointments with doctors.
- **Medical Bill Payment:** Handles patient payments and generates transaction IDs.
- **Pharmacy Stock Check:** Checks medicine availability in the hospital database.
- **Symptom Checker:** Uses AI to assist patients by analyzing symptoms and recommending next steps.

## Tech Stack
- **FastAPI**: Lightweight and high-performance backend framework.
- **LangChain & LangGraph**: Manages agentic workflows and decision-making.
- **SQLite**: Stores doctors, appointments, payments, and pharmacy data.
- **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini**: Provides intelligent chatbot responses.
- **MemorySaver**: Ensures chat memory is preserved across interactions.

## API Endpoints
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/chat` | Processes user input and returns chatbot response |

### Example API Request
```json
{
    "user_input": "Paracetamol is available in hospital pharmacy?",
    "thread_id": "12345"
}
```

### Example Response
```json
{
    "bot_message": "Paracetamol is available in the hospital pharmacy, with a stock quantity of 150."
}
```

## LangGraph Agentic Functions
### üîÑ Conversational Flow
- **StateGraph** is used to manage dialogue flow.
- **ToolNode** executes hospital-related tools dynamically.
- **Conditional edges** ensure smooth transitions between chatbot responses and tool executions.

### üß† Memory Management
- **MemorySaver** allows storing previous interactions for contextual awareness.
- Each conversation is associated with a `thread_id` to maintain continuity.
